# PyCBC

## Description
A python library meant for the tracing of backbone curves in nonlinear frequency responses

## Abstract
Unlike linear systems the line drawn to be drawn through the resonant peaks in a nonlinear system is not necessarily a vertical line at a specific resonant frequency. Therefore, a method was determined to deduce this 'backbone' curve for nonlinear systems using control. This repository was meant to serve as a collection of python scripts for the simulation or experimental testing of backbones. The method can found described in great detail in [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsv.2015.12.035).
